ClickEnchants allows players to enchant items by clicking them with an enchantment book. This will take experience points from the player as if they had combined the book with the item in an anvil unless they have permission to bypass the enchantment cost. There is also a configurable chance that enchanting an item will fail.



Note: You must be in survival to enchant items, it will not work in creative!
